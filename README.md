Basic python walkthrough.

Here I have provided a basic python programming for beginners.

You can find the jupyter notebook file in this directory where the codes are well written in simple language.To open (Basic_python.ipynb) you must have installed anaconda navigator by which you can lauch jupyter notebook.
If in case someone needs python file I have provided that too.
